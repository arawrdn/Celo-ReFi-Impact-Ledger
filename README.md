# 🌿 Celo ReFi Impact Ledger

## Project Overview

The **Celo ReFi Impact Ledger** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Celo blockchain. Its mission is to facilitate transparent and low-cost funding for real-world environmental and social impact projects.

By leveraging Celo's mobile-first approach and stablecoins (cUSD/cEUR), the platform ensures that donations are efficient and stable. Every contribution is permanently recorded, and contributors receive a unique **Impact NFT** as proof of their support.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Stablecoin Donations:** Accepts donations using cUSD or cEUR, ensuring value stability.
* **Transparent Funding:** All transactions and project balances are viewable on the Celo block explorer.
* **Impact NFTs (ERC-721):** Contributors receive a non-transferable token linked to their wallet, serving as an immutable, on-chain receipt for their specific donation and impact.
* **Project Management:** Allows for the creation and tracking of multiple, distinct impact projects with specific funding targets.
* **Mobile-First Access:** Designed with WalletConnect integration (using your Project ID: `a5f9260bc9bca570190d3b01f477fc45`) to provide a seamless experience for Celo mobile users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
